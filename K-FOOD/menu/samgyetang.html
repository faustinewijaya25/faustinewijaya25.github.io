    <p>Samgyetang (ginseng chicken soup) is a nourishing soup that’s made with a small, young chicken for its tender and tasty meat.
      The ginseng flavored meat is tasty and tender, and the broth is rich and delicious!
This boiling hot ginseng chicken soup, called samgyetang (???), is an iconic summer dish in Korea.
Sam(?) refers to ginseng (insam, ??), gye (?) means chicken, and tang (?) is soup.
It’s extremely popular as a nourishing food which helps fight the summer heat. </p>
<p>As the Korean saying goes, eating the hot soup is “fighting the heat with heat.”
On sambok(??) days, it’s a Korean tradition to eat foods that are healthy and restorative. Samgyetang is a popular choice.
Sambok days are 3 distinct days that mark the hottest summer period. Based on the lunar calendar, they are chobok(??, beginning),jungbok(??, middle) andmalbok(??, end).
 Tomorrow is malbok, which means the summer is winding down!</p>
<p>Hope you get to enjoy samgyetang before the summer goes by.
 But, don’t worry about it even if you don’t get to, this ginseng soup is a nutritious, comfort food which you can enjoy all year around!
 Here’s everything you need to know about Korean ginseng chicken soup!

    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    1. Clean the chicken. Do not cut off the neck and/or tail, if they are still attached. They help keep the rice inside the cavity.<br>
     Place the cleaned chicken on a cutting board or a large plate. Clean the inside of the cavity with a paper towel to remove any blood.
     Fold the attached neck into the cavity to close the hole. <br>
    2. Stuff the cavity with the sweet rice and a couple of garlic cloves, leaving room (about 1/4 of the cavity) for the rice to expand as it cooks.<br>
    3. To keep the rice inside the cavity while being cooked, use of one of these two methods:<br>
     (1) Make a small cut through the thick skin part between one thigh and the cavity opening, but not too close to the edge.
      Then, use your finger to expand the hole enough to fit the end part of a leg.<br>
       Bring the other leg over, and insert the end part through the hole to keep the legs crossed together,
       tucking the tail in to close the opening (see the photos above); <br>or (2) Simply cross the legs and tie together with kitchen twine.
       Tightly close the cavity with a toothpick if necessary. <br>
    4. In a medium size pot, place the chicken and add 5 to 6 cups (or enough to cover most of the chicken) of water or chicken stock.<br>
     Add the onion, garlic, ginger, jujubes, and ginseng. If the chicken came with the neck that's been cut off, add to the pot. <br>
     Also add the extra sweet rice to thicken the soup, if using. Blend the extra soaked rice with a little bit of water for a creamier texture,
     if desired.<br>
    5. Bring it to a boil over medium high heat. Skim off the foam on top. Cover, and boil for 15 minutes.<br>
     Reduce the heat to medium low and boil, covered, for about 25 minutes, depending on the size of the chicken.
     Turn the heat off and rest the chicken in the pot for about 10 minutes. <br>
    6. Serve piping hot with the chopped scallions and salt and pepper on the side so each person can season to taste.<br>
